<p style="text-indent: 25px;">
    Aikido is a modern Japanese martial art that is split into many different styles. 
Aikido is now practiced in around <b>140 countries</b>. 
It was originally developed by <b>Morihei Ueshiba</b>, as a synthesis of his martial studies, 
philosophy and religious beliefs. Ueshiba's goal was to create an art that practitioners 
could use to defend themselves while also protecting their attackers from injury. 
Aikido is often translated as <b>"the way of unifying (with) life energy"</b> or as <b>"the way of harmonious spirit"</b>.
According to the founder's philosophy, the primary goal in the practice of aikido is to overcome oneself 
instead of cultivating violence or aggressiveness.

<h3>Mental training </h3>
<p style="text-indent: 25px;">Aikido training is mental as well as physical, emphasizing the ability to relax the mind and body even under the stress of dangerous situations.
    This is necessary to enable the practitioner to perform the 'enter-and-blend' movements that underlie aikido techniques, wherein an attack is met with confidence and directness. 
Morihei Ueshiba once remarked that one "must be willing to receive 99% of an opponent's attack and stare death in the face" in order to execute techniques without hesitation. 
As a martial art concerned not only with fighting proficiency but with the betterment of daily life, this mental aspect is of key importance to aikido practitioners.
